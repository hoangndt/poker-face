## 🤖 AI Model Training & Management

### Overview

The system includes machine learning models that require training with customer data to provide accurate predictions. By default, models return "Model not trained" responses until properly trained.

### Training Workflow

#### Step 1: Check Model Status

```bash
GET /api/ai/model-status
```

**Response includes:**

- Training status of each AI model
- Data summary (total, churned, active customers)
- Recommendations for next steps
- Feature importance (if trained)

#### Step 2: Create Sample Data (Development)

If you need test data for development:

```bash
POST /api/ai/create-sample-data
```

**This endpoint:**

- Creates 20 realistic sample customers
- Includes both churned (20%) and active (80%) customers
- Adds variety in tenure, NPS scores, usage patterns
- Only creates data if you have fewer than 50 customers

#### Step 3: Train the Models

Once you have sufficient data:

```bash
POST /api/ai/train-models
```

**Requirements:**

- Minimum 10 customers total
- Must have both churned AND active customers
- Trains churn prediction, revenue forecasting, and lead scoring models

**Response includes:**

- Training success confirmation
- Model performance metrics
- Customer data statistics
- List of models trained

### Model Training Requirements

| Model               | Min Customers | Special Requirements            |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Churn Prediction    | 10            | Both churned & active customers |
| Revenue Forecasting | 15            | Customers with ACV data         |
| Lead Scoring        | 10            | Leads with conversion history   |

### Sample Training Response

```json
{
  "message": "Models trained successfully",
  "total_customers": 25,
  "churned_customers": 5,
  "active_customers": 20,
  "models_trained": ["churn_predictor", "revenue_forecaster"],
  "training_timestamp": "2025-09-23T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Production Training

For production environments:

1. **Use Real Data**: Import your actual customer data via CSV or API
2. **Schedule Retraining**: Set up regular model retraining (weekly/monthly)
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track prediction accuracy over time
4. **A/B Testing**: Compare model versions for continuous improvement

### Vietnamese Market Customization (Gradion Workflow)

The system includes Vietnam-specific models optimized for Gradion's workflow:

#### Lead Scoring Rules

- **≤109 points**: Classified as MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead)
- **≥110 points**: Classified as SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)
- **"Book Consultant" override**: Immediate SQL classification regardless of score

#### Cultural Considerations

- Longer relationship-building cycles expected
- NPS-based churn prediction with cultural interventions
- Region-specific assignment (DACH vs APAC markets)

#### Training Vietnam Models

```bash
# Check Vietnam-specific data quality
GET /api/vietnam/data-quality-report

# View intervention queue
GET /api/vietnam/cs-intervention-queue

# Test Gradion lead scoring
POST /api/vietnam/gradion-lead-score
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Backend

```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./customer_lifecycle.db
RELOAD=false
```

#### Frontend

```env

```

### Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with the following main tables:

- `customers` - Customer data and metrics
- `lifecycle_stages` - Stage transition history
- `customer_activities` - Interaction tracking
- `churn_predictions` - AI prediction results
- `revenue_forecasts` - Revenue predictions

## 🧪 Testing

npm test
```

### Load Testing

```bash
# Install artillery for load testing
npm install -g artillery
artillery run tests/load-test.yml
```

## � Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### AI Model Issues

**Issue: "Model not trained" responses**

```json
{
  "churn_probability": 0.5,
  "risk_level": "Unknown",
  "risk_factors": ["Model not trained"]
}
```

**Solution:**

1. Check model status: `GET /api/ai/model-status`
2. Create sample data: `POST /api/ai/create-sample-data`
3. Train models: `POST /api/ai/train-models`

**Issue: Training fails with "Need both churned and active customers"**
**Solution:**

- Ensure you have customers with `Churn_Flag = True` and `Churn_Flag = False`
- Use sample data creation endpoint if needed
- Minimum 10 customers with mixed churn status required

**Issue: Vietnam endpoints return 404 errors**
**Symptoms:**

```
GET /api/vietnam/data-quality-report → 404
GET /api/vietnam/cs-intervention-queue → 404
```

**Solution:**

- Check frontend API calls use `/vietnam/...` not `/api/vietnam/...`
- Verify baseURL is set to `http://localhost:8000/api`

#### Database Issues

**Issue: "CustomerData object has no attribute 'company_name'"**
**Solution:** This is a field mapping issue that's been fixed. Update to latest version.

**Issue: Empty database or missing customers**
**Solution:**

```bash
# Reinitialize database with sample data
cd backend
python init_db.py
```

#### Frontend Issues

**Issue: "No routes matched location" errors**
**Solution:** Route paths have been standardized:

- `/churn-prediction` (not `/churn`)
- `/revenue-forecasting` (not `/revenue`)
- `/pipeline-health` (not `/pipeline`)

**Issue: API connection failures**
**Solution:**

1. Verify backend is running on port 8000
2. Check CORS configuration in backend
3. Confirm frontend API base URL: `http://localhost:8000/api`

#### Docker Issues

**Issue: Port conflicts**
**Solution:**

```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
lsof -i :8000  # Backend

# Kill conflicting processes or change ports
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs:**

   ```bash
   # Backend logs
   docker-compose logs backend

   # Frontend logs
   docker-compose logs frontend
   ```

2. **API Documentation:**

    customer_data = extract_customer_data(data)
    await update_customer_stage(customer_data)
    return {"status": "processed"}
```

### Salesforce Integration

```python
# Example Salesforce API sync
from simple_salesforce import Salesforce

sf = Salesforce(username='user', password='pass', security_token='token')
leads = sf.query("SELECT Id, Email, Status FROM Lead")
for lead in leads['records']:
    await sync_lead_data(lead)
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Deployment

1. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with production values
   ```

2. **Deploy with Docker**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Health Checks**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
   curl http://localhost:3000/
   ```

### Scaling Considerations

- **Database**: Migrate to PostgreSQL for production
- **Cache**: Add Redis for session management

   # Clear node modules and reinstall
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Docker Issues**
   ```bash
   # Rebuild containers
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
